Practice section 1

Figure out the result of the following expressions:

a) (1 <= 1) and (1 != 1) - False
b) not (1 != 2) - True
c) ("good" != "bad") or False - False
d) ("good" != "Good") and not (1 == 1) - False

Make all of them True by adding parentheses:

a) False == (not True)

b) (True and False) == (True and False)

c) (not True) and ("A" == "B")
